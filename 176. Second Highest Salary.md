176. Second Highest Salary

Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
Example 2:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
```

```sql
WITH dedup_table AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT salary
    FROM Employee
),
rank_table AS (
    SELECT
        salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM dedup_table
)
SELECT 
(SELECT salary
FROM rank_table
WHERE rnk = 2) AS SecondHighestSalary;   
```

```sql
WITH dedup_table AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT salary 
    FROM Employee   
) 
SELECT 
(SELECT salary 
FROM dedup_table 
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary;       
```

```py
import pandas as pd

def combine_two_tables(person: pd.DataFrame, address: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    output = person.merge(address, how='left', on='personId') 
    output = output[['firstName', 'lastName', 'city', 'state']] 
    return output
```
