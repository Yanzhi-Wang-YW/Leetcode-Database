```py 
import pandas as pd

def project_employees(project: pd.DataFrame, employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame: 
    output = employee.merge(project, how='inner', on='employee_id') 
    output['rank_num'] = output.groupby('project_id')['experience_years'].rank(method='dense', ascending=False)     
    output = output.loc[output['rank_num'] == 1] 
    output = output[['project_id', 'employee_id']]      
    return output
