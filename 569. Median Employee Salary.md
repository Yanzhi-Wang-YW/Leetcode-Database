569. Median Employee Salary 
Table: Employee

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| id           | int     |
| company      | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
+--------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the company and the salary of one employee.
 

Write a solution to find the rows that contain the median salary of each company. While calculating the median, when you sort the salaries of the company, break the ties by id.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Follow up: Could you solve it without using any built-in or window functions
``` 

```py 
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 

def median_employee_salary(employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:  
    employee = employee.sort_values(['company', 'salary'])
    employee['rn'] = employee.groupby('company').cumcount() + 1  
    employee['total'] = employee.groupby('company')['id'].transform('count')  
    employee['check_median'] = np.where(
        (employee['total'] / 2 <= employee['rn']) & (employee['rn'] <= employee['total'] / 2 + 1), 
        1, 
        0 
    ) 
    employee = employee.loc[employee['check_median'] == 1, ['id', 'company', 'salary']] 
    return employee 
```
