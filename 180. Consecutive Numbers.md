180. Consecutive Numbers
Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column starting from 1.
 

Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH row_before_table AS (
    SELECT 
        num, 
        LAG(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS one_row_before,  
        LAG(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS two_row_before 
    FROM Logs     
)
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums  
FROM row_before_table 
WHERE num = one_row_before AND one_row_before = two_row_before

    output = output[['num']] 
    output = output.rename(columns={'num': 'ConsecutiveNums'})     
    return output
