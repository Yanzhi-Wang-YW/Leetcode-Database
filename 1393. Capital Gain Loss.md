1393. Capital Gain/Loss   
Table: Stocks

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| stock_name    | varchar |
| operation     | enum    |
| operation_day | int     |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(stock_name, operation_day) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
The operation column is an ENUM (category) of type ('Sell', 'Buy')
Each row of this table indicates that the stock which has stock_name had an operation on the day operation_day with the price.
It is guaranteed that each 'Sell' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Buy' operation in a previous day. It is also guaranteed that each 'Buy' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Sell' operation in an upcoming day.
 

Write a solution to report the Capital gain/loss for each stock.

The Capital gain/loss of a stock is the total gain or loss after buying and selling the stock one or many times.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Explanation: 
Leetcode stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.
Handbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.
Corona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each ('Buy' --> 'Sell') operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$
``` 

```py 
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 

def capital_gainloss(stocks: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame: 
    stocks['gain_loss'] = np.where(
        stocks['operation'] == 'Buy', 
        0 - stocks['price'], 
        stocks['price']   
    ) 
    stocks = stocks.groupby('stock_name').agg(
        capital_gain_loss=('gain_loss', 'sum') 
    ).reset_index()  
    return stocks  
```

 Here is the step-by-step table flowchart with the corresponding Python code for the `capital_gainloss` function.

### **Step 1: Calculate Individual Transaction Gain/Loss**
A new column `gain_loss` is created.
*   If the `operation` is **'Buy'**, the price is subtracted (treated as a loss/negative investment).
*   If the `operation` is **'Sell'**, the price is added (treated as a gain).

**Python Code:**
```python
stocks['gain_loss'] = np.where(
    stocks['operation'] == 'Buy', 
    0 - stocks['price'], 
    stocks['price']   
)
```

**Table Output (`stocks`):**
| stock_name | operation | operation_day | price | **gain_loss** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Leetcode | Buy | 1 | 1000 | **-1000** |
| Corona Masks | Buy | 2 | 10 | **-10** |
| Leetcode | Sell | 5 | 9000 | **9000** |
| Handbags | Buy | 17 | 30000 | **-30000** |
| Corona Masks | Sell | 3 | 1010 | **1010** |
| Corona Masks | Buy | 4 | 1000 | **-1000** |
| Corona Masks | Sell | 5 | 500 | **500** |
| Corona Masks | Buy | 6 | 1000 | **-1000** |
| Handbags | Sell | 29 | 7000 | **7000** |
| Corona Masks | Sell | 10 | 10000 | **10000** |

---

### **Step 2: Aggregate by Stock Name**
The data is grouped by `stock_name`, and the `gain_loss` values are summed to calculate the total capital gain or loss for each stock.

**Python Code:**
```python
stocks = stocks.groupby('stock_name').agg(
    capital_gain_loss=('gain_loss', 'sum')
).reset_index()
```

**Final Table Output (`stocks`):**
*(Calculations: Leetcode: -1000 + 9000 = 8000; Corona Masks: -10 + 1010 - 1000 + 500 - 1000 + 10000 = 9500; Handbags: -30000 + 7000 = -23000)*

| stock_name | capital_gain_loss |
| :--- | :--- |
| Corona Masks | 9500 |
| Handbags | -23000 |
| Leetcode | 8000 |
