Table: subscription_events

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    | 
+------------------+---------+
| event_id         | int     |
| user_id          | int     |
| event_date       | date    |
| event_type       | varchar |
| plan_name        | varchar |
| monthly_amount   | decimal |
+------------------+---------+
event_id is the unique identifier for this table.
event_type can be start, upgrade, downgrade, or cancel.
plan_name can be basic, standard, premium, or NULL (when event_type is cancel).
monthly_amount represents the monthly subscription cost after this event.
For cancel events, monthly_amount is 0.
Write a solution to Find Churn Risk Customers - users who show warning signs before churning. A user is considered churn risk customer if they meet ALL the following criteria:

Currently have an active subscription (their last event is not cancel).
Have performed at least one downgrade in their subscription history.
Their current plan revenue is less than 50% of their historical maximum plan revenue.
Have been a subscriber for at least 60 days.
Return the result table ordered by days_as_subscriber in descending order, then by user_id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Result: Churn Risk Customer
User 502:
Currently active: Last event is downgrade to basic (not cancelled) 
Has downgrades: Yes, 1 downgrade in history 
Current revenue (9.99) vs max (29.99): 9.99/29.99 = 33.3% (less than 50%)

Result: Not at-risk (subscription cancelled)
User 505:
Currently active: Last event is 'upgrade' to standard (not cancelled) 
Has downgrades: No downgrades in history 
Result: Not at-risk (no downgrade history)
User 506:
Currently active: Last event is downgrade to basic (not cancelled) 
Has downgrades: Yes, 1 downgrade in history 
Current revenue (9.99) vs max (29.99): 9.99/29.99 = 33.3% (less than 50%) 
Days as subscriber: Jan 20 to Mar 10 = 50 days (less than 60) 
Result: Not at-risk (insufficient subscription duration)
Result table is ordered by days_as_subscriber DESC, then user_id ASC.

Note: days_as_subscriber is calculated from the first event date to the last event date for each user
