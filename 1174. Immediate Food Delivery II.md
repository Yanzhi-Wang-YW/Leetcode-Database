1174. Immediate Food Delivery II  
Table: Delivery

+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
 

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The result format is in the following example.

Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
Output: 
+----------------------+
| immediate_percentage |
+----------------------+
| 50.00                |
+----------------------+
Explanation: 
The customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.
The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.
Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders

import pandas as pd

    delivery = delivery.sort_values(['customer_id', 'order_date'], ascending=[True, True])
    delivery['row_num'] = delivery.groupby('customer_id').cumcount() + 1 
    delivery = delivery.loc[delivery['row_num'] == 1] 
    delivery['is_same_day'] = np.where(
        delivery['order_date'] == delivery['customer_pref_delivery_date'], 
        1, 
        0 
    )
    total_cnt = delivery['delivery_id'].count()  
    same_day_cnt = delivery['is_same_day'].sum()    
    percent = int(same_day_cnt / total_cnt * 10000 + 0.5) / 10000.0      
    return pd.DataFrame({'immediate_percentage': [percent * 100]})
